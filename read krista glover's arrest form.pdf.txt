When I arrived on scene, 1 observed a male and a female standing on the front porch, In a verbal altercatlon. As I
approached the residence, the Complalnant, who was Identified as Krista Glover, met me In the roadway In front of
the house. Krista stated there was an altercatlon, however everything was fine and did not wish to have their
Information shared because of who they were. Krista stated she was a Glover, her mother-in-law was a Glover and
her husband was Lucas Glover. Krista stated the altercatlon was between her, her husband and her mother-in-law,
and her mother-in-law attacked her. Krista's mother-in-law and husband, Lucas Glover, was Identified by their
Issued driver’s llcense. While talking with Krista, there were no signs of an altercatlon or Injuries on her person.
Krista stated she did not need any medical assistance from Fire/Rescue, and how her dad was en route from Jupiter
Florida to pick her and their kids up. I Informed Krista to wait In the roadway, while I approached the residence to
check on Lucas and Hershey.
As I approached the residence, Lucas was standing on the front porch, while Hershey was standing In the den. 1
adviseci Lucas I would be right back to talk with him, and proceeded to enter the residence to check on Hershey
Glover. As I approached Hershey, I observed multiple lacerations to Hershey's left and right arm with blood on her
clothing and skin. After talking with Hershey, she advised she received cuts on both of her arms and was hit In the
chest during the altercatlon. I asked Hershey If she would like rescue to come to the residence tp complete a
medical evaluation, which she replied, "No". While talking with Hershey, Lucas stated to myself and his mom how
he was tired of the altercatlons and Krista always acting the way she does, and to go ahead and tell me (Deputy
Mayerlen) the truth of what happened. While talking with Hershey, she stated Lucas and Krista were In an
altercatlon. During the altercatlon, Hershey stepped In to stop the situation, at which time Krista turned her
aggression from Lucas to Hershey. Krista began striking Hershey In her arm, causing the lacerations to her skin.
During the altercatlon between Krista and Hershey, Lucas separated both parties and told them to go to their
respected rooms. I asked Hershey for a second time If she needed any medical treatment by Fire/Rescue, to which
she refused for a second time.
After talking with Hershey, I made contact with Lucas Glover. Lucas stated the altercatlon began earller In the
evening after playing a bad round of golf. Lucas advised me every time he plays poorly In a tournament, Krista
begins yelling at him, stating he IS a “loser’’ and “pussy’’ and ultimately starting an altercatlon with him about his
performance. Lucas stated Krista had been drinking throughout the day, and after playing a bad round of golf today,
she began yelling at him In front of their kids and his mother. Lucas advised Krista to stop the argument, while In
front of the kids. After arriving back at the residence, Krista proceeded to put their kids in bed. Lucas stated while
he was on the back porch relaxing from the day, Krista exited onto the porch and began a physical altercatlon with
him causing a laceration to his right arm. Lucas stated Krista acts this way and starts altercatlons all the time, but
has never done so In front of his mom. Due to the altercatlon occurring In front of Hershey, Hershey stepped In
between Krista and Lucas while telling Krista to stop In attempt to end the situation. At that time, Lucas stated
Krista redirected her anger and the altercatlon from him to his mom: During the altercatlon, Krista caused multiple
lacerations to both of Hershey's arms and was also striking Hershey In the chest. I asked Lucas If he was willing to
complete a sworn affidavit, regarding the Incident and altercatlon. Lucas stated he was willing to complete a written
statement.
After talking with all parties Involved, I exited the residence where I met up and spoke with Deputy L. Schneider.
While talking with Deputy Schneider, Krista's father arrived on scene. I advised him to remain near his vehicle for
the time being, while I figure out the situation going on. Krista's father complied with the orders given.
Due to the Injuries observed on Lucas's arm and his verbal statements made, probable cause was established to
arrest Krista for Domestic Battery. After securing Krista In handcuffs, Lucas became Irrational. Once Deputy
Schneider had control of Krista, I approached the front of the house where I met with Lucas to explain the situation.
While talking with Lucas, Depu  Schneider escorted Krista to the patrol car where she was going to secure her In
the back seat, as Krista was becoming verbally and physically aggressive. While escorting Krista to the vehicle, I
heard Deputy Schneider and Krista start yelling with each other. As I approached the vehicle and Deputy Schneider,
I observed Deputy Schneider pushing against Krista In attempt to put her In the back of the patrol car, as Krista was
tensing her body and blocking herself from sitting down In the car. While attempting to place her In the car, Krista
proceeded to wrap her legs and feet around the door and frame of the car preventing the lower half of her bodily
from entering the vehicle. By pushing and pulling. Deputy Schneider and I were eventually able to get Krista placed
In the back seat of the patrol car. After being secured In the back of the patrol car, Krista beqan screaming while

forcefully kicking the rear dnver’s side door of the patrol car causing the door to visibly separate from the cell of the
door frame. During the altercation, Lucas and Krista's father were standing in the roadway, observing the
altercatlon and Krista's resistance.
After advising Lucas of Krista's arrest, he proceeded to change his previous statement about the altercation. Lucas
then stated he was not fighting with Krista, and received the laceration during the altercation between Krista and
Hershey. After further conversation, Lucas refused to complete a sworn affidavit. While completing the Victim
information Biue Card and providing Lucas with Domestic Violence Packet, Lucas and Krista's dad continued to ask
and change the stories of what occurred to prevent the arrest of Krista. it should be noted Krista continued to yell at
her dad and Lucas from the back of the patrol car. Due to Krista not wearing any shoes, Lucas collected additional
clothing for Krista which was transported to the jail with her.
While talking with Krista's father and Lucas, Lucas proceeded to advise Deputy Schneider, Krista's father, and
myself again of what occurred eariier in the night. Lucas stated he wanted Krista's father to hear what has been
happening, as he was not aware of Krista's actions and how she was treating him. Again, Lucas stated how every
time he plays a bad round of golf, Knsta proceeds to start an altercation with him and telling him how he is a “ioser”
and a “pussy”, how he needs to fire everyone, and how he better win or her and the kids would leave him and he
would never see their kids again. Lucas stated he was tired of ali the aitercations and couldn't take it anymore. After
talking with Lucas and Krista's father, Lucas COTItinued changing his story and how no physicai aitercations
occurred.
Krista was transferred from Deputy Schneider's patrol car to mine, without further aitercation. Due the verbal
statements and injuries observed, Krista was transported to the jaii for Domestic Battery and Resisting without
Vioience.
Whiie en route to the jail, Krista continued yeiling she was hurting due to the handcuffs being too tight around her
wrist.. With Deputy Schneider following behind me, I notified Dispatch, via radio, that we were stopping at the Sheli
Gas statiorron A1A to loosen the handcuffs. After adjusting the handcuffs on Krista, with the supervision of Deputy
Schneider, Krista proceeded to remove her left hand from the handcuff, un securing herself in the back of the patroi
car. Deputy Schneider and I proceeded to re secure Krista behind her back to prevent further issues. Whiie en route
to the jaii, Krista spontaneously stated, ''Wait tiil the Tour hears about this, you will loose your job'', ''This is why
cops get shot in the face'' and ''Wait till I talk with the judge, you will be fucking fired over this''. Krista continued
yelling while being transported to the jail.
Lucas, Krista and their 2 kids, reside in the same house as an intimate married couple. At the time of the aitercation,
Lucas, Krista, Hershey and the 2 children were residing at the listed rentai property address. Hershey refused to
pursue charges against Krista for Battery, or complete a sworn affidavit. Photos where taken at the scene of Lucas
and Hershey's injuries, and a copy of the 911 call was collected and submitted into evidence. The Victim information
Blue Card was completed and submitted with the arrest report. I read the Domestic Violence questionnaire to Lucas
Glover, which he answered ''No'' to all three.
