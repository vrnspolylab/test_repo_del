a small hole in the drivers side.
Deputy Glidewell and Hempstead County Deputy Jerry Crider went to a residence in Saratoga where
Roger Stuart was at. Roger Stuart adniitted to the Deputy Crider that he did have a gun and did Еге

argued with his brother and that he did fire a shot in the air and one into the ground as his brother was
driving away.
